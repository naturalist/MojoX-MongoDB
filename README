NAME
    MojoX::MongoDB - Mongo Driver for Perl Mojolicious

SYNOPSIS
        use MojoX::MongoDB;

        my $connection = MojoX::MongoDB::Connection->new(host => 'localhost', port => 27017);
        my $database   = $connection->foo;
        my $collection = $database->bar;
        my $id         = $collection->insert({ some => 'data' });
        my $data       = $collection->find_one({ _id => $id });

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses the same API as MongoDB. The only changes between
    MongoDB and this modules are:

    *   The default datetime is changed from DateTime to
        MojoX::MongoDB::DateTime. This will considerably speed up all
        queries to the Mongo database that contain a date time object.

    *   Any::Moose is replaced with Mojo::Base

    Please refer to the MongoDB documentation and API for more information.
